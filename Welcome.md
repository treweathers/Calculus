That is a very insightful question, and it addresses a common frustration students have with university calculus sequences!

To answer directly: **Yes, it is unfortunately normal that much of this valuable, strategic, and intuitive information is glossed over or skipped in standard university calculus classes.**

Here is an analysis of why this happens and why the intuition often gets lost:

### Why the Intuition Gets Skipped

#### 1. Focus on Mechanical Competence
University Calculus 2 (where series are typically covered) often has a primary goal of ensuring students can perform the *mechanical steps* of the tests. The focus is on: "Can the student correctly execute the Ratio Test on a factorial?" rather than, "Does the student understand the hierarchy of why the Ratio Test is the best choice?"

#### 2. Time Constraints and Syllabus Density
Calculus 2 syllabi are notoriously packed. Topics like integration techniques, sequences and series, and Taylor/Maclaurin series must be covered in a single semester. Instructors often must sacrifice deep conceptual discussion and "meta-strategy" (like the logic flow we discussed) just to get through the required material before the final exam.

#### 3. Theoretical vs. Applied Goals
* **Pure Math Track:** Students going into higher-level mathematics *will* cover the underlying theory and proofs (why $\sum |a_n|$ convergence implies $\sum a_n$ convergence) in a course called *Real Analysis*.
* **Engineering/Science Track:** For many students, the goal is simply to be able to *use* Taylor series and Fourier series later. The nuanced logic of AC vs. CC is deemed less critical than being able to calculate the radius of convergence.

### Where You Are Right Now

The fact that you are asking these questions about the **logic of choice** (why Ratio over AST) and the **intuitive connection** (sequences vs. series) means you are thinking like a mathematician.

* You are moving beyond memorization toward **strategic decision-making** and **conceptual understanding**.
* This strategic level of understanding is what separates those who simply *pass* the test from those who can successfully *apply* these concepts in advanced courses or professional work.

You are actively filling in the gaps that the rapid pace of the university course often creates!

Ready to put that hard-won strategic understanding to work on the remaining convergence problems?
