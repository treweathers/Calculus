## 1. 🥇 Basics of Series & Convergence Tests (5 Problems)
This section includes problems focused on general convergence/divergence using standard tests (Ratio, Root, Telescoping, etc.) and defining series from partial sums.
* **P1.1 (Partial Sums):** If the $n$-th partial sum of a series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is $s_n = \frac{3n}{n^2 + 5n}$, find the first term $a_1$, the second term $a_2$, the general term $a_n$, and the sum of the infinite series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$.
* **P1.2 (Telescoping/Convergence):** Determine if the following series converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum: $$\sum_{n=3}^\infty \left(\frac{4^{n+1}}{5^{n}} - \frac{4^n}{5^{n-1}}\right)$$
* **P1.3 (Absolute/Conditional Convergence):** Determine whether the series is absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent, or divergent: $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\ln(n)}$$
* **P1.4 (Root Test):** Determine the convergence or divergence of the following series: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{3n^2 + 1}{2n^2 + 5}\right)^n$$

## 2. 🧭 Error Estimation & Remainder Bounds (5 Problems)
This section focuses on using the **Integral Test Remainder** and **Alternating Series Estimation** to specifically determine an error interval or the minimum required number of terms ($N$).
* **P2.1 (Integral Test & Remainder $N$):** Use the Integral Test to determine if the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty n e^{-n}$ is convergent. If it converges, determine a number $N$ so that the remainder $R_N$ is less than $0.001$.
* **P2.2 (Alternating Series Estimation):** Show that the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n^5}}$ is convergent, and determine a partial sum $s_N$ that will estimate the sum of the series with an error of less than $0.0001$.
* **P2.3 (Integral Test Remainder):** Estimate the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^4}$ using the sum of the first $N=4$ terms ($s_4$). Then, use the Integral Test remainder formula to provide a closed interval $[S_L, S_U]$ that bounds the true sum $S$.

## 3. 🔗 Power Series: Representation, Convergence & Applications (4 Problems)
This section focuses on finding power series representations, determining their radius/interval of convergence, and using them for operations (like integration, limits, or finding function sums).
* **P3.1 (Absolute/Conditional Convergence):** Determine whether the series is absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent, or divergent: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n} \cdot 5^n}{(n+1)!}$$
* **P3.2 (Convergence Tests):** Determine the convergence or divergence of the following series. If it converges and is a geometric or telescoping series, find the sum. $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{2}{n}\right)^{n^2}$$
* **P3.3 (Power Series Representation):** Find a power series representation for the function $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{1 - 3x^2}$ and determine the radius of convergence $R$.
* **P3.4 (Integral Approximation and Error Bound):** Estimate the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$ using the sum of the first $N=2$ terms ($s_2$). Then, use the Integral Test remainder formula to provide a closed interval $[S_L, S_U]$ that bounds the true sum $S$.

## 4. 📐 Taylor and Maclaurin Series (6 Problems)
This section contains problems focused on finding Taylor/Maclaurin series, finding polynomials, and applications such as approximating integrals and limits using series.
* **P4.1 (Taylor Polynomial and Accuracy):** Approximate $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ by its Taylor polynomial of degree 2 centered at $a=4$. Use **Taylor's inequality** to estimate the accuracy of the approximation $f(x) \approx T_2(x)$ when $x$ lies in the interval $[3.9, 4.1]$.
* **P4.2 (Maclaurin Series from Definition):** Find the **Maclaurin series expansion** of $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x^2}$ using the definition of a Maclaurin series (or knowledge of geometric series). Find the radius of convergence.
* **P4.3 (Taylor Series from Transformation):** Find the **Taylor series expansion** for the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ centered at $a=3$, and determine its interval of convergence.
* **P4.4 (Integral as Power Series and Approximation):** Express the indefinite integral $\int \cos(x^3) dx$ as an infinite series. Then, use the resulting series to evaluate the definite integral $\int_{0}^{0.5} \cos(x^3) dx$ to within an accuracy of $\mathbf{0.0001}$.
* **P4.5 (Limit Evaluation using Power Series):** Use a power series to evaluate the following limit: $$\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{e^{x^2} - 1 - x^2}{x^4}$$
* **P4.6 (Series Sum as a Familiar Function):** Find the sum of the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n \cdot 2^n}$ as the value of a **familiar function**.
